## Introduction

Taylor Swift, an influential artist in popular culture and the music industry, has one of the most largest and dedicated fan bases. However, with the recent incident with Ticketmaster in 2023 selling her Eras Tour tickets, many fans were frustrated about Ticketmaster’s inefficient ticketing system. Taylor Swift wants to change that.

Her team now needs a reliable website where she can sell her concert tickets efficiently. Taylor Swift needs her own “Ticketmaster.” We want to make our ticketing website trendy and fitting with Taylor Swift’s aesthetic. And the process starts by launching a new central hub for all of Taylor Swift’s concert tickets.

There will be no skeleton provided for this project since you are able to use any React framework/library you want. We would prefer if you completed it in **Next.JS** (but will not mark you down if you use something else). You are welcome to use NPM or Yarn when downloading dependencies.
